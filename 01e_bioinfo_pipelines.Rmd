# Bioinformatics Pipelines

## Mothur pipeline
- Mothur is an open-source software package for bioinformatics data processing.
- It is a very famous platform comprised of over 145 tools that can be integrated to for a desired pipeline. 
- Mothur has a [basic tutorial](https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/) that help users get started with 16S rRNA gene analysis. 
- We can download a stable platform from [here](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases/).

## QIIME2 pipeline
- QIIME2 is an open-source microbiome analysis platform with integrated software for quality control such as DADA2.
- It is a very famous platform with an active community forum. 
- QIIME2 has [profound tutorials](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/) that help users get started with 16S rRNA gene analysis. 
- We can instal the latest version from [here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/install/).

## Nephele Platform
